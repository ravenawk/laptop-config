# Laptop Config

A collections of ansible roles to setup a laptop/desktop for Linux/MacOS.

Should work with most Red Hat and Debian based distros as well as MacOS, tested mostly with Fedora.

The installs of chezmoi, wezterm, and neovim will now work on Fedora and Pop_OS(maybe pure debian) system currently.

## ToDo
- rework variable names
