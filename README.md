# Laptop Config

A collections of ansible roles to setup a laptop/desktop for Linux.

Should work with most Red Hat and Debian based distros, tested mostly with Fedora.

## ToDo
Lots of things including
- rework variable names
- expand out to work with macos 
  split out a couple tasks to their own roles (ie neovim)
